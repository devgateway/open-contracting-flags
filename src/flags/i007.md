#### Notes

Current version implements this as "single supplier", not "single bid". This should be changed. Two suppliers collaborating on a single bid violates the spirit and language of this indicator just as much as a single supplier being the only bidder.

#### Issues

The current version of this uses `awards.suppliers._id` which is what is modelled in mongodb. I think OCDS uses `awards.suppliers.id` ?
