#### Parameters

- `soleSourceLimits`: a mapping between `bidType` values and their associated sole-source limits

#### Calculation Description

- iterates through every awarded sole-source contract
- for each contract, looks at its `bidType` and compares it to the provided `soleSourceLimit`
- if the award's value is above the sole source limit then 

#### Default Sole Source Limits

- bid type 1 (Hàng hóa): 2,000,000,000 (goods)
- bid type 3 (Xây lắp): 5,000,000,000 (construction)
- bid type 5 (Tư vấn): 3,000,000,000 (services)
- bid type 10 (EPC): 5,000,000,000 (construction)
