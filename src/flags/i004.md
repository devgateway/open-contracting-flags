#### Parameters

- `soleSourceLimit`: the maximum permissable amount for a sole-source contract (default: 5,000,000,000)
- `threshold`: the percent distance below the sole source limit which is considered suspicious (default: 5%)

#### Calculation Description

- Creates a count of "suspicious contracts" for each supplier and initialize it to zero
- Iterates through every sole source award in the collection and checks if it's either above the sole source limit or within a configurable threshold of the sold source limit (e.g. within 5%)
- For every award that is either above the limit or within the threshold, the count for that award's supplier(s) is incremented by one
- All sole source contracts for suppliers with more than one sole-source award within the threshold of the sole source limit are flagged

#### TODO

- should this indicator be time-bound? many of the similar indicators are
- currently flagging *all* of a suppliers contracts if any of them fit this criteria. should be adapted to only flag the ones that fit this criteria (as a side note, might be worth including the idea of flagging suppliers independently of their contracts)
- needs to be updated with dynamic sole-source limits
- split into two indicators
