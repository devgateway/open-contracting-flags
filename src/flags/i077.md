#### Parameters

- `timePeriod`: the rolling time period within which to count the number of awards (default: 365 days)
- `maxAwards` the maximum number of awards permitted to a supplier within the given time-period from a single procurement entity

#### Calculation Description

- iterates through releases and indexes each award by its supplier ID, procurement entity ID, and date (if an award has multiple suppliers, multiple index entries are made)
- sort the indexed records by award date
- procede sequentially through the index in rolling sequential time blocks (according to `timePeriod`), counting the number of awards to each supplier from each procurement entity within each time block
- if any count of combined supplier/procurement entity exceeds the configured `maxAwards` parameter for a given time block, flag all contracts for that supplier/procurement entity with the time block
