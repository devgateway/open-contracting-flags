#### Parameters

- `threshold`: the percentage threshold which is considered (too close) to the estimated solution (default: 1%)

#### Calculation Description

- iterates through the entire list of releases
- for each release, calculates the percent difference between the contract's estimated amount and the winning bid amount and flags any release where the winning bid is less than the configured `threshold` away from the estimated amount

#### Notes

- similarly to i085, the direction of comparison can change whether or not the percentage difference is inside/outside of the proposed threshold for the same two values. for this indicator, the comparison direction of `(estimated - winning) / estimated` is used.
- this calculation assumes that, for the winning award, `release.awards.value.amount` refers to the bid amount, not the eventual award/contract amount (which is true for OCVN data as currently modeled in our database)
