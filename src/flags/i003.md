#### Further Discussion

Itâ€™s a little ambiguous whether this indicator should apply in the case that there is only one bidder for a tender. While only having one bidder is problematic, it feels like a different sort of problem than having multiple bidders who are ruled ineligible. Further, Indicator 007 captures the single-bidder case already. If we choose to exclude single-bidder tenders from this indicator, then release.awards.length > 1 should be added to the preconditions.
