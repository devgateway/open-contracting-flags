#### Parameters

- `threshold`: The minimum number of days expected between `tenderPeriod.startDate` and `tenderPeriod.endDate` (default 7)

#### Calculation Description

- iterates through all releases and flags any release where the period of time between the tender period start date and the tender period end date is less than the configured threshold

#### Further Discussion

Current calculations use `tenderPeriod.startDate` and `tenderPeriod.endDate` which are mapped to `BID_START_DT` and `BID_END_DT` in the Vietnam data. However, based on the spirit of the indicator, an equal cause for concern would be a short time frame between the announcement of the tender and the closing of bids, rather than the opening of bids and the closing of bids. There is also the issue of where/how the tender is advertised, and a tonne of local complexity that varies by context. For now though, the submission period may be the best option that we have for stnadardized calculations...
