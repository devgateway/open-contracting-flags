#### Notes

This indicator is particularly interesting b/c it could theoretically raise a flag before bids are submitted or an award is actually made

#### Further Discussion

Right now weâ€™re using `tenderPeriod.startDate` and `tenderPeriod.endDate` which are mapped to `BID_START_DT` and `BID_END_DT` in the Vietnam data. However, based on the spirit of the indicator, an equal cause for concern would be a short time frame between the announcement of the tender and the closing of bids, rather than the opening of bids and the closing of bids. There is also the issue of where/how the tender is advertised, and a tonne of local complexity that varies by context. For now though, the submission period may be the best option that we have for stnadardized calculations...
