#### Notes

- for tenders with multiple winning bids, if any of the successful bids is an exact percentage apart from any of the unsuccessful bids then the indicator is flagged
- direction of comparison matters. for instance, `(Winning - Losing) / Losing` will yield a different result than `(Losing - Winning) / Winning`, one of which may not be an exact percentage when the other one is. For the moment both directions of comparison are analyzed.
- implementations of this indicator should be careful about floating point rounding errors
