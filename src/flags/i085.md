#### Parameters

`None`

#### Calculation Description

- iterate through every tender, and create a list of winning and losing bids
- for every combination of winning and losing bids, calculate the percent difference in both directions, i.e. [(winner - loser) / loser * 100%] and [(loser - winner) / winner * 100%]
- if the percent difference for any winning + losing bid combination, calculated in either direction, is an exact integer (e.g. 10%, 22%, etc.) flag the contract

#### Notes

- for tenders with multiple winning bids, if any of the winning bids is an exact percentage apart from any of the losing bids then the indicator is flagged
- direction of comparison matters. for instance, `(Winning - Losing) / Losing` will yield a different result than `(Losing - Winning) / Winning`, one of which may not be an exact percentage when the other one is. For the moment both directions of comparison are analyzed.
- implementations of this indicator should be careful about floating point rounding errors
